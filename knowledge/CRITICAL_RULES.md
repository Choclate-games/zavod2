# Non-Negotiable Platform Rules

Distilled from shipped HTML5 games on Yandex Games, VK, OK, CrazyGames and
Playgama. Every rule here corresponds to a bug that reached production or a
moderation rejection. Violating any of them ships a broken or rejected game.

## Boot & lifecycle

1. `game_ready` is sent **once**, only after assets are loaded and the menu is
   interactive — never right after `bridge.initialize()`.
2. **Nothing in the boot path may await a player decision.** An `await
   authorize()` during boot hangs the game for 100 % of guests.
3. Wrap `bridge.initialize()` in a timeout (~10 s) and keep a boot watchdog
   (~15 s) that sends `game_ready` anyway — a blocked SDK must not mean a
   permanent black screen.
4. Drive `bridge.setGameLoadingProgress()` from real milestones, and hold
   `game_ready` until the splash has reached 100 %.
5. Any boot step awaiting an animation frame needs a deadline: a hidden tab
   delivers no frames.
6. Pause and audio come from `bridge.platform.on(EVENT_NAME.PAUSE_STATE_CHANGED /
   AUDIO_STATE_CHANGED)`, not from `visibilitychange` alone. Reset the delta
   accumulator on resume and clamp `dt`.

## Authorization

7. `authorize()` is called only from an explicit player action — **except** VK/OK,
   where it is silent and runs at boot before saves, time-boxed to ~5 s.
8. Guests have a non-null `id` and `name`. The only reliable check is
   `player.isGuest`.
9. On VK/OK report the player as authorized regardless of the token.
10. `authorize()` may resolve `false` instead of rejecting — treat that as a
    refusal and fall back to the raw `isAuthorized` flag.
11. Filter placeholder names (`Guest…`, `player`, `unknown`) and use your own
    localized label instead.

## Storage

12. One save key, one JSON object, normalized on read — a corrupt or truncated
    save must boot on defaults.
13. Bridge v2 takes **no `storageType` argument**; it picks cloud vs. local.
14. `localStorage` is a mirror only — it is third-party storage in the platform
    iframe (partitioned in Chrome, culled in Safari). Settings such as mute,
    volume and language live in the save, not in `localStorage`.
15. Never swallow a cloud read failure silently — it downgrades a cloud save to a
    device-local one.
16. Flush on `pagehide` and `visibilitychange`, not `beforeunload`.
17. Daily/timed content uses `bridge.platform.getServerTime()`, never the device
    clock.

## Ads

18. A rewarded reward is granted **only** on `state === 'rewarded'`, never when
    the promise resolves.
19. Always `off()` the rewarded listener, and guard re-entry — otherwise two
    clicks pay out twice for one ad.
20. No interstitial at boot, mid-gameplay, over a screen being read, or right
    after a purchase. Natural breaks only, traceable to a click.
21. Never call `showInterstitial()` from a state method; the click handler decides.
22. Keep the game-side interstitial floor ≥ the platform's configured minimum.
23. Never re-request a banner that is already shown; on VK/OK request it once per
    session and never refresh.
24. A sticky banner can be drawn over the game — measure whether the viewport
    actually shrank and reserve the strip if not, or the bottom UI row becomes
    unreachable.
25. Premium ("no ads") suppresses interstitials and banners but **keeps** rewarded.

## Payments

26. `consumePurchase(productId)` — the product id, never the purchase token.
27. Check `getPurchases()` at every launch: **grant first, then consume.**
    Consuming without granting destroys paid goods.
28. Keep one exported list of consumable ids; divergent copies drop products.
29. Never hardcode prices — read `getCatalog()` asynchronously and cache.
30. If `payments.isSupported` is false, paid items show as free — no locks, no
    prices.

## Capability gating

31. UI is built on capability flags. A control for an unsupported feature is
    **not rendered at all** — not disabled, not erroring on tap. Applies to
    leaderboards, payments, rewarded, auth and every social action.

## Compliance (Yandex)

32. Lock the page globally before anything paints: `position: fixed` body,
    `overscroll-behavior: none`, guarded `touchmove`, and document-level capture
    handlers for `contextmenu` / `selectstart` / `dragstart`.
33. Refuse multi-touch on `touchmove`, never on `touchstart` — cancelling the
    second finger breaks two-thumbed controls. Never `preventDefault()` inside a
    real scroller or a form control.
34. Inset every UI layer by `env(safe-area-inset-*)`; only the art layer reaches
    the physical edge. Keep `viewport-fit=cover`.
35. Never size UI from `100vh`: publish the measured height to `--vp-h` and
    re-measure across a settling window after fullscreen changes.
36. Audio via the **Web Audio API** only — an `<audio>` element puts a media
    player in the notification panel and on the desktop UI.
37. Menus never scroll the page; long content goes into an explicit inner
    scroller.
38. The game title must be byte-identical everywhere in the draft.
39. Every language-dependent string is translated; keys exist in all locales and
    placeholders match. Never concatenate sentences.

## Delivery

40. `dist/` is what ships — rebuild after any change to `src/` or the bridge
    config; a zip step alone re-packs a stale build.
41. Redeploy the whole `dist/`: `platform-bridges/*.js` are separate chunks and a
    stale one keeps the old behaviour.
42. One codebase, one build. Branch on `bridge.platform.id` and capability flags,
    never fork per platform.
43. Test in the platform's own frame (Yandex draft via `sdk-dev-proxy`) as guest
    **and** authorized before submitting.

## Audio

44. All sound goes through **one master `GainNode`**; mute, ducking and the
    platform's audio flag touch nothing else. Ramp the gain — an instant change
    clicks.
45. The `AudioContext` starts **suspended** until a real user gesture. Resume from
    the first gesture, and never block boot or `game_ready` on it.
46. Keep the player's mute and the platform's mute as separate inputs, or
    returning from an ad un-mutes a player who muted deliberately.
47. Do not additionally mute around your own `showRewarded()` call — the platform
    pause event already covers it, and doubling up leaves the game silent when the
    ad fails to open.

## Social

48. Every social action is capability-gated and its flags are **properties, not
    functions**. Hide the whole entry point when nothing is supported.
49. Call social methods **synchronously inside the real pointer handler** — an
    engine-frame callback loses the popup on VK/OK. Grant rewards after the call.
50. A rejection is the player closing a dialog, not an error: never show a failure
    message, and never gate progression behind a social action — portals reject it.
51. Publisher data (community ids, share URLs) belongs in the bridge config, not in
    game code: on v2 the config wins, and an `undefined` runtime value overwrites a
    configured one.

## Renderer

52. Auto-tuning quality from raw frame time does not work under vsync — every frame
    takes ≈ the refresh interval regardless of GPU load. Measure the cadence between
    **rendered** frames and discover headroom by optimistic probing.
53. Never target above the panel's refresh rate, and never launch in reduced quality
    and crawl up — start optimistic and step down.
54. Apply resolution and shadow-map changes **before** `render()`, on a frame you
    actually render; doing it after clears the canvas and flashes a blank frame.
55. One group, one degree of freedom. A mesh that both steers and spins (wheel,
    turret, limb) needs **nested** groups — `Euler('XYZ')` applies the inner
    rotation around the parent's axis and visibly skews the part otherwise.
    See `knowledge/threejs/vehicle_wheel_rig.md`.

## Touch controls

56. Touch controls are built on **Pointer Events** with `setPointerCapture` and
    per-`pointerId` tracking — `touchstart/end` alone loses fingers at element
    borders and lets a second finger cancel the first (nitro kills throttle).
57. Movement and the primary action must be usable **at the same time**. In a
    driving game throttle never shares an axis with steering: it is a separate
    pedal button, the largest control on screen.
58. The control layer sets `touch-action: none`, cancels `contextmenu`,
    `dragstart` and non-passive `touchmove`, and respects `env(safe-area-inset-*)`.
    Without this the page scrolls, pull-to-refreshes and gets rejected by
    moderation.
59. Controls are visible only during gameplay and are **reset** whenever hidden,
    on `blur` and on `visibilitychange` — a transparent control layer over a menu
    swallows button taps, and a held throttle survives an ad break otherwise.
    See `knowledge/ux/touch_controls.md`.

## Development log

60. Every work session ends with an entry in `DEVLOG.md` (task, what was done,
    files touched, what was verified, what remains) and in `CHANGELOG.md` under
    `## [Unreleased]` in player-facing language. A change nobody can reconstruct
    later is a change that will be redone from scratch.
